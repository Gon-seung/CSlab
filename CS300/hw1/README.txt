Please complete the three functions in the skeleton code:

linear_search (20 points)
binary_search (40 points)
distinct (40 points)
Please read the comments in the skeleton code carefully and implement accordingly.

Please implement them the way you learned them from the lecture; that is, please do not use some internal python language features and/or standard library to complete the task. The crucial role of the program must be implemented by you, not by the library/language feature.

For example, please do not use index(), in, set, or sort(). However, you are allowed to import random and use for ... in range(...) and len().

Please implement distinct using hashing the way it is in lecture slide.
